# Rules
Apply the following rules to the codebase

## Shadcn Rule
1. You must use `npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>` to add new shadcn components. Never use `npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component-name>` because it is deprecated.

## EsLint Rule
1. Make sure you fix all the linting errors and warnings.

## Vite + React + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript Rule

1. Use 'use client' directive for client-side components
2. Style with Tailwind CSS utility classes for responsive design
3. Do not export pages as default, instead export them as named exports and import them with the page name.
4. Import ui components using absolute paths starting with @/components/ui.
5. Do not import React for client-side rendering components.
